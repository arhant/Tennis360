Project Idea: ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) and WTA (Women's Tennis Association) are the official tennis organizing and annual tour management bodies for men and women respectively. Each tour year hundreds of matches are played across various tournaments throughout the world. The data for a year itself is humongous with match scores, stats, and details.

Below is an example of the data from Miami Open 2018 underway now:

  -Mid-Match Summary for S. Williams Vs N. Osaka

  -Miami Open 2018 – Women’s Singles: First Round

Records by Roger Federer, Serena Williams and other prominent players are well known and some data analytics (such as Maximum aces in a year) gathered by SAP and IBM are available on the official sites. We would try to provide further insights about tennis and the players, including and not limited to:
  
  • Which Player is the best at defending their title?
    
  • Top Players (based on Rankings, Prize money, Non-Grand Slam Tournament winners) without having won Grand Slams
  
  • Top Players (based on Grand Slam Winners, Prize money, Non-Grand Slam Tournament winners) not ranked Number #1.
