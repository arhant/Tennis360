Project Idea: ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) and WTA (Women's Tennis Association) are the official tennis organizing and annual tour management bodies for men and women respectively. Each tour year hundreds of matches are played across various tournaments throughout the world. The data for a year itself is humongous with match scores, stats, and details.

Records by Roger Federer, Serena Williams and other prominent players are well known and some data analytics (such as Maximum aces in a year) gathered by SAP and IBM are available on the official sites. We would try to provide further insights about tennis and the players, including and not limited to:
  
  - **Best Defending Player** : Which Player is the best at defending their title?
  - **Players Winning their 1st Grand Slam** :based on Rankings, Prize money, Non-Grand Slam Tournament winners
  - **Players becoming No #1** : based on Grand Slam Winners, Prize money, Non-Grand Slam Tournament winners
